# Colophon
This website is entirely [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page): it does not require any dynamic language or any javascript code, but only HTML and CSS. It respects web standards: it even works on Internet Explorer 5.5! Particular attention is paid to [typography](http://webtypography.net/) and to [vertical motion](http://webtypography.net/2.2.2).

The pages are produced with the static website generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The website is then hosted and served thanks to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

Each page header is illustrated with a part from the ["Turgot" map of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgot_map_of_Paris), created in the 18<sup>th</sup> century by Louis Bretez.
