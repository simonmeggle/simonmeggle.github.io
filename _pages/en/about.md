## About

### Colophon
This website is entirely [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page): it does not require any dynamic language or javascript library. The pages have a minimal weight and need only one single query. Particular attention is paid to [typography](http://webtypography.net/) and to [vertical motion](http://webtypography.net/2.2.2).

To this end, the articles are written with [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) and the pages are produced with the static website generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The website is then hosted on a personnal [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) and served by [Nginx](http://nginx.org). 

The [source code](https://github.com/sylvaindurand/sylvain.durand.tf) is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sylvaindurand/sylvain.durand.tf).
