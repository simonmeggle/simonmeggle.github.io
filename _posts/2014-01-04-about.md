### Colophon
This website is entirely static, that is to say only designed in HTML/CSS and without dynamic language such as PHP. It does not use javascript code, except for the generation of the mathematical formulas. With the aim to be as speed as possible, the pages have minimal weight and require only a single query.


To this end, the site was produced with the static website generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The pages are hosted on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and served by [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). The code is colored by [Pygments](http://pygments.org/), and formulas are generated by [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/).


The articles "[Multilingual website with Jekyll](/multilingual-website-with-jekyll/)" and "[Static website with Cloudfront](/static-website-with-cloudfront/)" partially describe how this result was obtained. For the rest, you can consult the [source code](https://github.com/sylvaindurand/sylvain.durand.tf) published on [GitHub](https://github.com/sylvaindurand/sylvain.durand.tf).
